# Junior-Design-Studio-Robotics (JDS - Robotics)
 Junior Design Studio Robotics (EE 3002) is an introductory robotics course offered at LUMS. As the Teaching Assistant for this course, I completely redesigned the lab manuals to improve the learning experience of the incoming students. This GitHub repository serves as a platform to share those revamped lab manuals.
